# Contributing to PyEuropeana

**Hello there!** We created this document as a way to communicate with potential contributors (that's you) and to establish a common ground over which we can keep on growing and solidifying the PyEuropeana project. If you made up your mind about being a contributor, **that's great!** Reading through this document can help you immensely and cut back on the time you need to contribute to PyEuropeana. If you are not sure about being a contributor yet or if you are just taking a look, then this document can still provide you some insights about how we go about developing PyEuropeana.

## Different ways of contributing

So, what do we mean by contributing? One thing that probably comes to your mind is **writing Python code and adding it to the PyEuropeana codebase.** This code can be:

- the code necessary for a new feature
- code for the refactoring of the existing codebase
- a bugfix

However, **writing code is not the only way through which you can contribute to PyEuropeana.** For us, contribution also includes:

- Offering feedback on the project
- Submitting bug reports
- Submitting feature requests and enhancement proposals
- Improving API documentation
- Improving high-level documentation files (like this file and README.md)
- Adding tutorials and use cases
- Increasing test coverage

**All of these items are valuable to us as dealing directly with the codebase.** Do not hesitate to communicate with the maintainers if you have a question, an idea, or a proposal.

## Communicating with the maintainers

### Who are the maintainers?

The PyEuropeana project is maintained by a core group of developers from Europeana. . **This group of people from Europeana who are responsible for the development and maintenance of this project are called *the maintainers.***

### How do I initiate communication?

If you have any idea about potential contributions or a request, it is a good idea to first get into contact with them or at least to look at the current issues that are being discussed. You can do that through [the **issues tab** found in the project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/europeana/rd-europeana-python-api/issues). You can use the issues tab not only to request or propose enhancements, but also to:

- Give feedback
- Ask questions
- Create a discussion topic
- Point at bugs

If you want to initiate discussion regarding any of these, click on the **new issue** button and start writing! 

### Writing a meaningful issue

With this said, here's a list of tips and best practices that can help you in getting your request, idea or message across.

1. Choose a meaningful title. The title of your issue should be brief yet informative about its scope. Refrain from composing titles like *x doesn't work* or *please help me!*. Instead, briefly mention what the issue is about.
2. Use prefixes in the title. You've seen above that we were able to roughly classify different reasons for communication. It is a good idea to prefix your title by using the following prefixes:
   1. *feedback:*...
   2. *question:*...
   3. *discussion:*...
   4. *bug:*...
   5. *enhancement:*...
3. Add more context to prefixes by using labels. GitHub allows us to tag issues with labels while you are working on composing them. We've prepared a list of eight labels that can further add context to your issue. These labels are:
   1. *feedback*
   2. *question*
   3. *discussion*
   4. *potential-bug*
   5. *confirmed-bug*
   6. *general-enhancement*
   7. *feature-enhancement*
   8. *documentation-enhancement*
4. If you are reporting a potential bug, provide context and code. Stating the exact conditions under which you encountered a problem will help you get to a solution faster. By stating the exact conditions, we mean:
   1. Briefly explaining what the bug you encountered is. Is it an error? Is it a mismatch of expectations?
   2. Listing the details of the computational environment you encountered the bug in. What version of the package? Which Python version? Which operating system?
   3. A minimally reproducible code snippet that can be used to replicate the error. Try to tidy up your code beforehand so that we can understand it better.
5. If you are proposing or requesting an enhancement of any kind, try to explain the reasoning behind your request or proposal. Why was this enhancement needed? What problems does it solve?
