About Europeana
================

What is Europeana?
-------------------

`Europeana <https://www.europeana.eu/en/about-us>`_ empowers the cultural heritage sector in its digital transformation.  We develop expertise, tools and policies to embrace digital change and encourage partnerships that foster innovation.  We make it easier for people to use cultural heritage for education, research, creation and recreation. Our work contributes to an open, knowledgeable and creative society.

We have more than 50 M Cultural Heritage objects rich in content and metadata that can be accessed by our `APIs <https://pro.europeana.eu/page/apis>`_


Why PyEuropeana?
-------------------

Although `Europeana APIs <https://pro.europeana.eu/page/apis>`_ are publically available we felt the need to have an interface for a general audience, and therefore we created a Python client library

With `PyEuropeana <https://github.com/europeana/rd-europeana-python-api>`_ we want to facilitate access to our data and contribute to the Python ecosystem for Artificial Intelligence

If you are a developer ready to help build PyEuropeana read our contribution guidelines `Contribution Guidelines <https://github.com/europeana/rd-europeana-python-api/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_
